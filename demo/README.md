## reel board Demo

To fully program all the building blocks of the reel board, Phytec has provided this sample program, which includes all the sensors, LEDs and pushbuttons. The measured values are displayed on the ePaper display. As an Eddystone Beacon the reel board sends the URL https://www.zephyrproject.org/.

The stored images together with the source text should help to open up the functionality of the program. The URL for the sample program is https://github.com/jfischer-phytec-iot/zephyr/tree/pr-reel-basic/samples/boards/reel_board/demo .
